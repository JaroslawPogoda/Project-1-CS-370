# Project-Final-CS-370 
Project discription:

Assignment is to develop a stand alone and self-sufficient java app in form of a jar that will allow one to connect to any Oracle or mysql database server at a remote location, and perform DML operations (i.e., select, delete, update and insert) restricted to only the DB object created by your group. Schema and tables must use the group name as a prefix.  You get extra bonus if you can accomplish the following:  1. Establishing the connection through secured SSL channel.  2. Handling BLB or CLOB objects with output encoded using base64.   These cases should be helpful to get you start: 13833, 17529, 17531, and 17558.   The last review for this exercise is Oct 13 if you do not want to run into time crush for the other java programming labs.
